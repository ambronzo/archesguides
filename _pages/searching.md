# Filtering
There are multiple parameters you can choose to filter your search results by. Multiple filters can be layered together to further narrow your results and all of the currently applied filters will be displayed in the search field. These filters can then be removed independently by clicking the 'x' inside each filters colored box.

## By area
Searching by area allows you to sort results based on their geographical location. You can create an area around a point, line, or polygon and set the buffer distance around each in which you want results to be included.

## By time
Time filters require you to select the type of time range you want to sort by from the appropriate resource model you're searching for. You can either enter a range in the time filter or select one from the time wheel.
