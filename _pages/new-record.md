To create a new record, go to the "Add New Resource" tab and select one of the resource models loaded into your project.
![Create Record]({{site.url}}/assets/images/resourceCreate.png)
# Resource Structure
The record you are creating will be displayed as a card tree made up of the blank cards from its resource model. Each card represents a NodeGroup made up of individual Nodes that are created when you fill the data fields that make up each card.
## Branches
Branches are a non-editable version of a resource model that can be used in multiple records and types of resources. Branches allow you to reuse complex node structures across multiple records.
## Cards
When you enter data into your record, you are creating a card. Cards can contain multiple data nodes and can be nested within other cards.
