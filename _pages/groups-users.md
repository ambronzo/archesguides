Arches installs with a handful of pre-existing groups with permissions already set to help organize users. Groups are managed from the Django Administration page where all users and groups are created as well as edited.
=======

**Notice:** It's best to leave the default groups that come with Arches intact and create your own new groups if you want to create different permission configurations.
