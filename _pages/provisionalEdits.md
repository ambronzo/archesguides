Depending on what user group you're in and what your project administrators have set your permissions to, your edits may be classified as 'Provisional' when you first make them. To maintain the integrity of a projects database, Arches has a built in quality assurance system that allows a set group of resource reviewers to examine provisional edits and then approve or decline them. Your provisional edits will be marked by this ![Yellow card icon]({{site.url}}/assets/images/yellowIcon.png) yellow card icon in the resource editor. Provisional edits are created in one of two ways:
1. Editing a record and changing a Nodes existing value. You are replacing some previously approved data with something new and a resource reviewer will decide whether to approve your changes, replacing the old data with what you entered, or to preserve the previously approved data.
2. Adding a new node to an existing record or creating a new record and adding a node to it. In this case, the resource reviewer will decide to either approve the new node, adding it to the record as authoritative data, or decline your additions, deleting the node you created.
# Viewing Your edits
Before approval, your provisional edits will only be visible to you and resource reviewers. To view any edits you have made and check their approval status, open the ![Recent edits tab]({{site.url}}/assets/images/recentEditsTab.png) "My Recent Edits" tab in the upper right.

From the dropdown you can see all of your previous edits and click the ![Recent edits tab]({{site.url}}/assets/images/provEditButton.PNG) to open the resource you made changes to in the resource editor.
