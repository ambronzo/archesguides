## What is Arches?
Arches is a web-based, geospatial information system for cultural heritage inventory and management. The platform is purpose-built for the international cultural heritage field, and it is designed to record all types of immovable heritage, including archaeological sites, buildings and other historic structures, landscapes, and heritage ensembles or districts.

## What can administrators do with Arches?
Arches provides core services for creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources. Because resources are defined as graphs, Arches allows administrators to import and parse resource graphs, as well the ability to create and interact with instance graphs. Explore our Admin Guide and discover key administrative capabilities within Arches including creating a database schema, individually configuring settings, and managing specific thesauri.

## Administrator FAQs
**We would like to be able to share some information with the public, but also hide some sensitive data that we donâ€™t want to be publicly available. Can we do that using Arches?**  

Yes! Arches allows extremely granular control over which users or groups of users (such as the general public) have access to specific items of information. In fact, a system administrator can control access at a field-by-field level.

***If it is a requirement to be able to make a version of our repository available to the public over the internet, can we do that using Arches?***  

Yes! Arches provides many intuitive ways for the public to search the data that you make available online and to access information related to heritage places.

***If it is a requirement that only staff of our organization have access to our repository, can we still use Arches?***  

Yes! An organization can set up Arches for internal use and access only.
